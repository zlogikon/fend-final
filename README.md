# Weather-Journal App Project

This project was created as part of Udacity's Front End Design Nanodegree program.

The project was designed to give experience working with webpack, node.js, web APIs, responsive design, sass, service workers, and jest.

## Overview
This project takes 3 items of user input: a destination, a travel start date, and an end date. The app then retrieves data from 3 APIs: Geonames, Pixabay, and Weatherbit. The server returns the data and the webpage is updated with an image of the destination, weather predictions, and travel dates. Travel dates also include the duration of the trip and a countdown.
